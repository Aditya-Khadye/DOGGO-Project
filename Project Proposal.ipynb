    "Objective:\n",
    "For this project, we’re building a CNN model for image classification. The main goal is to train a model that can accurately predict categories based on image inputs. We’ll use a dataset from Kaggle (or create our own if needed), making sure we have enough labeled images to train and validate the model properly. Our CNN will include multiple convolutional layers, max pooling, and ReLU activation to extract meaningful patterns. To optimize performance, we’ll experiment with Adam and SGD optimizers, adjusting hyperparameters like the number of filters, kernel size, stride, and batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re using PyTorch since it’s great for deep learning and allows for easier model building and GPU acceleration. To validate the model, we’ll use a train-test split, cross-validation, and metrics like accuracy and precision. Overfitting is something we’ll watch out for, so we might use dropout and regularization techniques to improve generalization. The goal is to iterate and refine the model until we get strong, reliable predictions.\n",
